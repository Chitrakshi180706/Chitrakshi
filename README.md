# Chitrakshi
Personal GitHub profile README — focused on backend development with Python and clean system design.

# Hi, I’m Chitrakshi 👋

I’m a Computer Science undergraduate (AI) with a strong interest in **backend development using Python**.

I focus on understanding how backend systems work in practice — from designing APIs to managing data and writing clean, maintainable server-side code. I prefer building strong fundamentals and improving gradually rather than rushing through tools.

---

## 🧭 What I’m Focused On

- Backend development with **Python**
- Designing and building **RESTful APIs**
- Working with **MySQL** and relational databases
- Writing clean, structured, and readable code
- Using **Git & GitHub** for version control

---

## 🛠️ My Approach

- Learn concepts deeply before applying frameworks  
- Build small, functional systems before scaling  
- Prioritize clarity, consistency, and correctness  
- Improve projects iteratively based on learning  

---

## 📌 Current Stage

I’m actively strengthening backend fundamentals and working toward building practical projects that reflect real-world use cases.  
This profile will evolve as I design, build, and refine those systems.

---

## 🎯 Long-Term Goal

To grow into a reliable software engineer capable of designing clear backend systems, working confidently with data and APIs, and contributing meaningfully to engineering teams.

*Focused learning today. Strong systems tomorrow.*
